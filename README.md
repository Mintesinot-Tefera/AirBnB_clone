#AirBnB clone

#Description
This project is a command-line interface (CLI) implementation of a simplified Airbnb management system. It allows users to interact with and manage Airbnb-like listings and user data using commands entered into a console.
#Command Interpreter
The command interpreter (CLI) is designed to accept commands from the user and execute corresponding actions on Airbnb listings and user data. It provides a text-based interface for interacting with the application's functionalities.
#How to Start the Command Interpreter
Run the command interpreter
./console.py
This command assumes you have Python 3 installed on your system and have set the script console.py as executable (chmod +x console.py if not set).
#How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can interact with it using commands in the following format:
(command) (arguments)
1. Show all Airbnb listings:
all Place
2. Update an Airbnb listing:
update Place <place_id> price_by_night=200
3. Quit the command interpreter:
quit
For more detailed command options and usage instructions, refer to the project's documentation or use the help command within the console.
